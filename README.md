# The Floor-Type-Detection-Dataset (FTDD) repository
Repository for the floor type detection dataset (FTDD/ FTD Dataset) recorded with the Unitree Go1 Edu robot dog by using the code from [Unitree-Go1-Edu](https://github.tik.uni-stuttgart.de/ac136427/Unitree-Go1-Edu) repository. The program is split in two parts:
1. Data preparation: Prepare raw measurement data to be easily loadable by a custom PyTorch dataset class (including unification of timestamps, window creation for timeseries data, ...)
2. Dataset creation: Create a PyTorch dataset with configurable data preprocessing (image cropping, ...) data selection (usage of subset of sensors possible) and failure case creation (by modifying the data)

For more details about how to create a dataset see the following chapters. 


# How to use the code to create a new dataset from measurements?
This section explains how to use the code in this repo for creating a dataset usable in PyTorch from measurements. Further details about the code can be found in later chapters.
### Prerequisites
1. Measurements with the Unitree Go1 by using the code from [Unitree-Go1-Edu](https://github.tik.uni-stuttgart.de/ac136427/Unitree-Go1-Edu) are available

### Data preparation
1. Change variable "measurement_path" in *data_preparation_main.py* to the location of the measurement for which data preparation shall be done (can be a normal directory or a zip file)
2. [Optional] Change config for data preparation in *configs/data_preparation_config.gin*
3. Execute program *data_preparation_main.py* and wait till it finished
    - *NOTE:* If you want to have a look at the results, you can uncomment the call of function visualize_result() in line 97 which will show a plot for each timestamp after data preparation finished => If you don't want to have a look at all images, you can abort the execution with Ctrl + c in the command line
4. Copy results from newly created **results/** dir to a new location for your dataset
5. Repeat step 1 for the next measurement
6. Copy only directories containing data from **results/** dir to your dataset location
7. Append the content of *results/labels.csv* to the *labels.csv* file in you dataset location
8. Repeat from step 5 until you performed data preparation for all measurements
9. Update all locations with "TODO" in *datasheet.md* in your dataset location  

### FTDDataset class
1. Import the class FloorTypeDetectionDataset() class from file ./FTDDataset.py
2. Provide the following parameters for your dataset class:
    - *root_dir (str):* Path to prepared dataset
    - *sensors (list):* List of all sensors which shall be considered
    - *mapping_filename (str):* filename of the label mapping JSON file
    - *preprocessing_config_filename (str):* Name of the preprocessing JSON file in the configs/ dir of the repository    
    - [Optional] *faulty_data_creation_config_filename (str):* Name of the faulty data creation JSON file in the configs/ dir of the repository. If nothing is provided, the data won't be manipulated.
3. [Optional] Change config to your needs. The following config files are relevant for the dataset creation:
    - *configs/faulty_data_creation_config.json:* Config for failure case creation (selection of parameters for data modification and which sensors shall be modified)
    - *configs/label_mapping_full_dataset.json:* Mapping of label name to integer value. You can alternatively also use the file *configs/label_mapping_binary.json* if you are using and older version with only two labels.
    - *configs/preprocessing_config.json:* Config for the data preprocessing, e.g. image cropping and resizing
4. Create list with sensor names which shall be used, e.g.: *sensors = ["accelerometer", "BellyCamRight"]*
5. Create instance of FloorTypeDetectionDataset() class by providing parameters from step 2
6. Use the dataset as every other PyTorch dataset

# Folder structure and module descriptions
This section contains a brief overview about all files in the repository. The code is structured in four modules/subfolder which contain code for different purposes.

    - *label_mapping_binary.json:* 
    - *label_mapping_full_dataset.json:* 
    - *preprocessing_config.json:* 
- **custom_utils/** \
This module contains some custom utility functions used in the repository.
    - *utils.py:* Utility functions to handle data (copy data and clear temporary directories)
- **data_preparation/** \
This module contains 
    - *image_preparation.py:*
    - *incomplete_data_cleanup.py:*

- **failure_case_creation/** \
This module contains 
    - *modify_images.py:*
    - *modify_timeseries.py:*
- **testdata/** \
This directory contains some example data, so you can run *data_preparation_main.py* by default to get an idea of how to use it.
