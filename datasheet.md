# Details about dataset
In this section you will find answers to several questions about the wip_dataset_name dataset. The questions are a subset of the questions proposed in the paper "Datasheets for Datasets" from T. Gebru et al. which can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010 \
The purpose of this chapter is to hopefully answer all questions which could arise when using this dataset.
## Motivation
### **Q: For what purpose was the dataset created?**
A: The dataset was created for the research thesis FA 3526 at the IAS Institute from University Stuttgart. The aim of the research thesis was to create a dataset for multi-modal machine learning for classifying different types of floor (e.g. grass, concrete, ...) which a mobile robot ([Unitree Go1](https://www.unitree.com/en/go1/)) is moving on.
### **Q: Who created the dataset and on behalf of which entity?** 
A: The dataset was created by the student Dominik Eißen (TODO: Note additional support) on behalf of University Stuttgart.

## Composition
### **Q: What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: What data does each instance consist of?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Is there a label or target associated with each instance?** 
A:  TODO
### **Q :Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Is any information missing from individual instances?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?** 
A: The dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external resources.
### **Q: Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor– patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?** 
A: No, the dataset does not contain data that might be considered confidential.
### **Q: Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?** 
A: No, the dataset does not contain such data.

## Collection Process

### **Q: How was the data associated with each instance acquired?** 
A:  TODO
### **Q: What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?** 
A:  TODO
### **Q: Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Over what timeframe was the data collected?** 
A: TODO

## Preprocessing/ cleaning/ labeling
### **Q: Was any preprocessing/ cleaning/ labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/ cleaned/ labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Is the software that was used to preprocess/ clean/ label the data available?** 
A: TODO

## Uses
### **Q: Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?** 
A: The dataset was used for the research Thesis FA 3526 at the IAS Institute from University Stuttgart.
### **Q: What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?** 
A: TODO
### **Q: Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses?** 
A: TODO

## Maintenance
### **Q: Will the dataset be maintained or updated?** 
A: TODO
